### Note on examples

Examples were taken form `tests` dir of the original projet. I assume `_std` files were generated with the version that was installed at that moment at Mueller Group server.

Unfortunately current latest java version outputs does not direclty match `_std` files, yet it is a good place how parameters in python wrapper affect resulting `kpoints`.
